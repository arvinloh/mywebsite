Hello! Welcome to the blog of my website.

As I am writing this, I am still in the process of setting up this website.

### Blog Outline

Here is the rough outline of what I am planning to write about in my blog:

- My thoughts on technology and software development
- Study notes and summaries of books, articles, and papers
- My experiences and learnings from my projects
- `A story of my life` series
- My `novel` series

### Purpose of the Blog

I will be using this blog to share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences. I hope you find it interesting and useful.

I am looking forward to sharing my journey with you.
