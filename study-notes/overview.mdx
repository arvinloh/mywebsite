# Getting Started

Over the past year of learning Computer Science, I have compiled a bunch of my notes in **Notion**.

I have recently decided to migrate it to my website.

## What I have studied and written

<u>
  <mark>Basics</mark>
</u>

- R (Visualising)
- SQL (Database)
- Java (OOP)
- JavaScript (Web-development)

<u>
  <mark>Intermediate</mark>
</u>

- C++ (Versatile)

<u>
  <mark>Advanced</mark>
</u>

- Python (ML/AI)

Among these interesting languages that I have learn, I had decided to write about Python and C++.

It is mainly because, Python and C++ are the two language that I know the most about.

### What you'll need
